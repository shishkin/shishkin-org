# Sergey Shishkin

## Technical Consultant and Coach

As continuous learner, knowledge multiplier and software gardener with
20 years of experience, I help teams increase productivity, establish
continuous learning culture and steadily deliver customer value. I have
both deep and broad expertise in software development practices. I'm an
active member of various professional software development communities
and occasional conference speaker on topics of interest and expertise.
My interests include functional programming languages, systems thinking,
decentralization and coaching.

## Areas of Expertise

<div className="blocks">
<section>

### <Icon name="ion:navigate-outline" class="icon" /> Business Agility

What's the point of a high-performing agile development team, if the product backlog for the next two years is set in stone?

Studies in complex adaptive systems show that businesses need to learn to respond to complex world by probing and sensing, rather than analyzing.
While successful innovative products look like magic, they're fruits of deliberate work and experimentation.
**Design Thinking**, **Human-Centered Design** and **Design Sprint** consistently help sensing market needs, formulating and executing experimental probes in a lean way.

Psychological safety is a prerequisite for organizations to start turning failures into learnings and learnings into successes.

### <Icon name="ion:rocket-outline" class="icon" /> Technical Excellence

Great technology contributes significantly to speed of delivery.
Great use of technology even more so!

Technology buzzwords of the day matter only if they bring measurable net-positive effect on the organization.
Strategic **Domain-Driven Design** helps tackle technical debt where it matters most.
**Observability** supports data-driven decision making.
**CI/CD** automation reduces risk of failures and shifts left quality and security controls.
**Cloud** and **serverless** infrastructure align IT costs with revenue growth and make experimentation cheaper.

On top of that, continuous and sustainable pace of technology innovation attracts and retains top talent.
And that feeds into self-reinforcing positive cycle.

### <Icon name="ion:trail-sign-outline" class="icon" /> Consulting

During over two decades in the IT industry I've worked in small startups and regulated multi-national corporations.
In the end of the day, everyone wants to ship better products cheaper and faster.
Although every team and situation is different, there are good practices worth knowing.
On top of that teams and organizations need to establish an adaptable culture that can deal with changing circumstances without much drama.
If your organization is stuck in a transformation, I can help you out.

- automation of cloud infrastructure provisioning;
- robust and scalable back-ends and event-driven data pipelines;

I value simple, pragmatic solutions and automation of repetitive and error-prone tasks like testing and deployment.
